Many individuals strive to achieve an ideal work-life balance, yet struggle due to the multifaceted nature of work-life balance itself. Work-life balance is impacted by various factors while constituting 5 dimensions in itself. One with a poor work-life balance may then be impacted by a wider range of negative outcomes, such as health and life satisfaction. By possessing a deeper understanding of this dataset, we are able to better understand how these factors interact with each other, and how to improve one’s work-life balance overall. Through this analytics project, we can first identify factors that can best improve one’s work-life balance. Understanding that it is not an easy feat to satisfy each dimension of work-life balance, we would also like to seek how one may focus on specific dimensions that apply most relevantly to their profession and daily lifestyle. By exploring the link between different factors, we will be able to see how the dimensions depend on one another as life satisfaction cannot be built based on only a single aspect of lifestyle. Building a user-facing Dashboard with this dataset is possible as many areas can be explored accordingly based on the directions intended.

This dataset is provided by Yvon Dalat. This dataset revolves around survey responses on 24 attributes that describe one's lifestyle and behaviour. It contains 15, 977 survey responses. Measuring life satisfaction is based on 5 dimensions: healthy body, healthy mind, expertise, connection, and meaning. ‘Healthy body’ reflects physical and nutritional health aspects, and ‘Healthy mind’ reflects emotional, psychological, and social aspects of well-being. ‘Expertise’ measures expertise growth in interest and ‘connection’ evaluates the tendency to explore the world and social engagement. Lastly, ‘Meaning’ assesses the individual levels of altruism (compassion and generosity) and thriving in life. This data was collected from July 2015 to March 2021. This dataset is for public interest and global engagement, to support the UN Sustainable Development Goals by investigating lifestyle factors on human well-being. Data was collected through Work-Life Balance survey responses.
