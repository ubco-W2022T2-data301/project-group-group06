    "**Research Question: Overall, does a healthy mind dimension help to maintain low-stress levels? If so, which factors of the healthy mind dimension are related to low-stress levels and how does it differ based on one's demographic information?**\n",
    "\n",
    "Stress level is affected by many different factors, I assume that factors related to a healthy mind would impact stress level the most. Also, people who are having a healthy mind, a good emotional, psychological, and social well-being, would have a low-stress levels. Among the different factors in the healthy mind dimension, I am wondering which factors would contribute the most to the low-stress level and it differ based on one's demographic information such as gender and age. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Analysis Plan\n",
    "\n",
    "1. I will subset the factors (FLOW, DAILY_SHOUTING, WEEKLY MEDITATION, DAILY_STRESS, AGE, and GENDER) that I am interested in from the whole dataset.\n",
    "2. I would like to remove missing values (NA) that might negatively impact on the result.\n",
    "3. I will consider outliers in the dataset in the next analysis.\n",
    "4. I will create a new column, combine all 3 factors and see if healthy mind factors, together, helps to maintain low-stress level\n",
    "5. I would investigate the correlation of each factor with stress levels. I would visualise each correlation using a scatter plot to show the correlation and relative information such as the error bar and line of best fit.\n",
    "6. Then I would compare the correlation value to find a factor that impacts low-stress levels the most. \n",
    "7. I plan to compare the correlation of each factor by visualising it in one plot since all three measures are in the same unit (0 - 10 times).\n",
    "8. I would use 100% stacked bar, Diverging bars instead of simple bar graph side by side to visualise the data.\n",
